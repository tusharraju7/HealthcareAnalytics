### Post-Vaccination Hospitalization Symptom Prediction
This repository contains a predictive model developed to identify significant symptoms leading to hospitalization after vaccination, using the 2021 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data. The project aims to improve healthcare responses by pinpointing critical symptoms that could escalate to severe conditions.

**Features:**
1.**Data Integration:** Combines multiple VAERS datasets from 2021, including vaccination and symptom data.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Involves filtering relevant columns, one-hot encoding of symptoms, and random sampling to handle computational limitations while ensuring class balance.
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Employs logistic regression to determine the significance of various symptoms in predicting hospitalization.
4. **Model Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of 75.84%, with 'Injection Site Erythema' identified as a significant predictive feature.

**Objective:**
To assist healthcare professionals and researchers in understanding and managing post-vaccination adverse events more effectively, thereby enhancing patient care and vaccine safety protocols.
